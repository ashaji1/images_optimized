Movie and TV Show context menus have an 'Extras...' listing.

This will open a window with information about the movie/tv show including cast, ratings, similar media, reviews, etc.

Also can be set in Settings->General->Navigation->Action for movies/TV Shows to open to this window when a movie/tv show is selected in Fen.
