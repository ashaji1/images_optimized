[COLOR red][B]A HUGE thankyou to Tinuz97 for all his work searching for untranslated strings and translating Fen for Dutch Language use! I can't thank him enough!![/B][/COLOR]

- Removed "Advanced" settings file. All users must now use the default settings file, which was previously the "Basic" file. With Kodi 19 coming, and a new settings layout being encouraged, I can no longer maintain 2 separate settings.xml files.
- Fixed downloading for a Premiumize Cloud result.
- A lot of work done with converting Fen to using language strings. This won't be noticed by most users, but it takes A LOT of work and time to do. Currently only English and Dutch are supported. You can make a string.po file for another language and send it to my Github if you want it supported.
- Various other fixes/changes.
